# 🏠Housing Price Predicition Project


.. By Şule Ahmet and Hamza Darwish  
Welcome to our House pricing prediction project. Using a tuned XgBoost model, this project takes in a number of inputs (house size, room number, etc) from the user through an HTML and JS based frontend and routes the data through an API to the model and gives the user an output, denoted in TRY, through the API and frontend.  


# 📋 About the project  
**Model:** Tuned XgBoost regression model.  

**Objective:** Predict the price of a real estate in Türkiye depending on 15 different factors.   

**Evaluation Criteria:** Mean Average Error (MAE), Real Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R^2.  

**Deployment Platform:** Render, for both the API (Deployed as a web service), and the Frontend (Deployed as a static website).
