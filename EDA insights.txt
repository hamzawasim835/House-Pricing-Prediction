Initial Observations based on EDA:

None of the numerical features have a bell curve, but some are more skewed than others.

Price and size initially go well together, but as size increases the connection breaks down until it stops being a useful predictor entirely.

Similarly for room number, it starts out being strongly related to price, until it stops being so. 

Inland cities are generally cheaper.

Istanbul has both a higher median price and a wider range of prices that are still non-outliers.
